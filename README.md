Introduction
Pandas library offers a wide range of functions. It helps in data manipulation and provides a large pool of functionalities for almost every task. One common Pandas function is pandas describe. It presents the user with a descriptive statistical summary of all the features of the dataset. Though it is useful to understand the data still it doesnâ€™t offer many features.
Pandas profiling is the solution to this problem. It offers report generation for the dataset with lots of features and customizations for the report generated. In this article, we will explore this library, look at all the features provided, and some of the advanced use cases and integrations that can prove useful to create stunning reports out of the data frames!
